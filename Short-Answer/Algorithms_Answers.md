## Exercise I

a) O(n)


b) O(n^3)


c) linear recursive call 0(n)

## Exercise II

You can do either iterative sort to go one by one until the egg breaks from the drop, then you will find f by subtracting that floor to 1.

You can do a quicker way, a binary search, where you find the half way floors, and drop it, if breaks, then you do the same thing to the other half, until you find the right floor.
